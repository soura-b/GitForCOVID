# GitForCOVID
Using GitHub to organize COVID emergency response.


# The Question
Can we use GitHub to maintain patient records in a hospital? Here is a possible approach, and some illustrations.


# Motivation
With second wave of COVID burning through India, many organization are responding by setting by hospitals. I learnt about one such organization, Doctors for You (https://doctorsforyou.org/), which has - as on May 09 2021 - set up 16 COVID hospitals.

From a leader in this organization, I found out that these hospitals require the following:
1. Supply chain management - for drugs
2. Personnel management - for doctors, nurses and paramedics
3. Bed allocation - these hospitals are inpatient care facilities
4. Patient tracking - admission, treatment and discharge

This post seeks to address items 3 and 4.


# Approach
GitHub is likely the world's most used software development, and it's bug/ spec management feature (called `Isssues`) lends itself to tracking other things too. Issues are composed of comments, they can be tagged, assigned to milestones, and opened/ closed. These features are mapped to patient management and bed allocation functionalities as described in the following section.

Other useful features of GitHub (for this use case) are - role-based access control, data isolation (using repositories), and app-based access.


# Stucture
1. Issue Title > Patient Name
2. Issue Comment 1 > Gender, DoB/ Age, Family member details
3. Issue Comment 2 >  
4. Issue Opening Date >  


## Example
1. Sample hospital with 10 beds
  1. 5 in a male ward (green), and 5 in a female ward (blue).
